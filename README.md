###### (i have no name for this project rn)

Created this from an inspiration of trisimetral work of Rose.

Site renders cubes with circles in lines. 

Currently from (0, 0, 0) to point (x, y, z)

> *Sometimes beauty lies in simplicity* ~ Rose â™¡

#### To-do:

- [x] Enable to create lines from (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2)

<sup> done on 31.12.22 </sup>

- [x] Create panel that allows user to input points on site

<sup> done on 30.12.22 </sup>
