## geo-rose
###### (i have no name for this project rn)

Created this from an inspiration of trisimetral work of Rose.

Site renders cubes with circles in lines. 

Currently from (0, 0, 0) to point (x, y, z)

#### To-do:

- [x] Enable to create lines from (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2)
###### done on 31.12.22

- [x] Create panel that allows user to input points on site
###### done on 30.12.22

- [ ] Change input panel to something more user-friendly and pretty
