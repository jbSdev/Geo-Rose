## geo-rose
###### (i have no name for this project rn)

Created this from an inspiration of trisimetral work of Rose.

Site renders cubes with circles in lines. 

Currently from (0, 0, 0) to point (x, y, z)

#### To-do:

- [ ] Enable to create lines from (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2)

- [ ] Create panel that allows user to input points on site
